# JPMorgan-DA-and-Dashboards
Oct - Nov 2025

This project is based on synthetic banking data inspired by JPMorgan. The objective is to perform an in-depth analysis of multiple data sources, including sales, customer, and salary data, to uncover meaningful trends and patterns. By applying data analysis and visualization techniques, I aim to translate complex raw data into actionable business insights.

The final deliverable will be an interactive dashboard that presents a holistic view of the organization’s performance metrics. This dashboard will enable key stakeholders to make data-driven decisions more effectively, such as identifying profitable customer segments, designing targeted marketing campaigns, and optimizing operational strategies. In essence, the project bridges data analytics with business intelligence, transforming information into strategic value for decision-makers.
